Happy Birthday, baby! I know it will sound, super cheesy, but seriously Sunn, you're the best. Every moment with you feels like winning the lottery, yaar!

aapko yaad hoga our first eye contact, then baar baar same eye contact ðŸ‘€ hona and also that moment jab maine himmat karke kitkat li on chocolate day for you but de nhi paya? Yaar that makes me smile ðŸ«  every single time I think about it.
And One thing I did not told you that when i used to go to coaching in nangloi mai jaan bhuj k agar nagar jata tha by walk, so that mai aapko dekh saku kisi rickshaw mai wapas aate hue, I know aisa bahut rarely hota tha like week mai 1-2 baar, but still when i used to see you mood accha ho jata tha, even there we used to have eye contact sometimes i don't know if you remember this or not, but jo bhi tha accha tha old school love type. I only regret this thing if we would have met before ðŸ˜”, but let it be maybe it was not in god's plan

Seriously though, you're incredible. Sometimes I wonder how we even became friends. Thanks for making me realize I deserve love and happiness, and for being the most amazing person ever.

Itni taareef sunkar jyada chane ke jhaad pe mat Chad Jana ðŸ¤­. I know ki life kabhi kabhi perfect nahi hoti, aur unexpected challenges hum par aate rehte hain. So kabhi jyada overthink mat karna bas current moments ko enjoy karna. I know I'm not the best but I'll always be there for you.

Haa, pata hai mai kabhi kabhi rude ho jaata hoon, but yaar, aap samajh jaati hai na mujhe  and also mera bina bataye so jaana. But meri bas ek shikayat hai mere call and msgs ka reply de diya karo jalli ðŸ˜•.

Happy Birthday, baby! My favorite panda. You're literally the best thing to ever happen to me, and I ain't leaving your side easily. Promise! Please don't ditch me either, okay? You make me feel happy and
comfy, yaar Jiske saath I can share my feelings my thoughts without getting uncomfortable.

Have the craziest, bestest birthday ever, my baby!
